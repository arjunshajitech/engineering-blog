# The Power of Sharing Knowledge

It’s easy to feel valuable when everyone depends on you for answers.  
But holding onto all the knowledge can lead to stress and burnout.  
Instead, **sharing what you know** can make your work (and life) much easier.

## Why Share?

- **Less Stress**: When others know what you know, you’re not always on call.  
- **More Growth**: With fewer interruptions, you can focus on learning new things.  
- **Stronger Team**: A team that shares knowledge can work smoothly, even when someone is away.

## How to Start?

1. **Write things down**: Document key processes.  
2. **Teach others**: Take time to explain your work to teammates.  
3. **Encourage questions**: Make it easy for others to ask and learn.

Sharing knowledge doesn’t make you less valuable—it makes you a better teammate.  
Let’s build stronger teams by sharing what we know!
