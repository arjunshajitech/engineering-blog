We often feel the urge to rewrite code because:  
- The setup feels messy.  
- The logic seems too complex.  
- The codebase is challenging to work with, and so on.

These concerns are natural, but rewriting isn’t always the best solution.  

As the famous saying goes, **“Don’t reinvent the wheel.”**

The real question is: **When should we rewrite?**

- The technology is outdated and limits growth.  
- Performance bottlenecks.  
- The cost of maintaining the old system outweighs the cost of rebuilding.  
- Security vulnerabilities cannot be patched effectively.  
- The architecture no longer supports new business needs.  
- Integrating with modern tools and APIs is too complex.  
- The system is unstable, with frequent crashes or failures.

Engineering is about smart decisions—not just fresh starts.  

Know when to **refactor**, when to **optimize**, and when to **start over**.
