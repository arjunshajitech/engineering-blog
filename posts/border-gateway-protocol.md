Let me explain.

You can think of **BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)** like the delivery partner in Swiggy or Zomato. When you place an order, the delivery person doesn't just take any random route they find the fastest and most efficient path to reach your location. Similarly, BGP figures out the best possible route for your data to travel across multiple networks, making sure it reaches the destination as quickly and efficiently as possible.

We all know that the Internet is a massive network connecting countless computers around the world. But behind the scenes, it's not just one giant web it's actually made up of many smaller networks working together. Among these, there's a special kind called an **Autonomous System (AS)** think of it as an independent network that helps route data across the Internet.

Not every computer or server connected to the Internet is an Autonomous System. To become one, a network must apply through a **Regional Internet Registry (RIR)**. Once approved, it receives a unique **Autonomous System Number (ASN)** from IANA for example, `AS112299`. ASN are 16 bit numbers between one and 65534 and 32 bit numbers between 131072 and 4294967294. As of 2025, there are approximately **120,000 ASNs** in use worldwide (external BGP). This number acts like an official ID, making the system globally recognizable as part of the Internet's routing backbone.

Internal BGP (iBGP): BGP used within a single Autonomous System to share routing info between its own routers.
Example: YouTubeâ€™s routers inside AS100 share routes with each other to send traffic efficiently.

External BGP (eBGP): BGP used between different Autonomous Systems to exchange routes with other networks.
Example: YouTube (AS100) shares routes with Cloudflare (AS200) so users can reach YouTube reliably.

Now, here's where things get interesting. For example many people think that when they click a YouTube thumbnail or hit "play" on a video, their request travels straight from their device to YouTube's servers once the DNS resolves the domain name into an IP address. Sounds simple, right? But in reality, that's not what happens.

Your data doesn't take a direct flight it goes on a journey across multiple networks, **hop** (Hopping means the process of data traveling from one Autonomous System (AS) to another as it moves toward its destination. Each step from one AS to the next is called a hop.) from one Autonomous System to another. With the help of **BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)** the Internet's "delivery boy" your request finds the most efficient route available. It passes through several networks around the world, sometimes thousands of them, before finally reaching YouTube's origin server (or, more likely, a local cache closer to you).

The Internet is constantly changing. Old computers and networks go offline, while new ones pop up every day. To keep everything connected and up to date, the **Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)** plays a crucial role. It helps all the Autonomous Systems (AS) stay in sync by sharing information about which networks are reachable and how to get there.

As humans, we're curious about what could go wrong, what happens when an AS accidentally gives a wrong route to the next AS?

One notable BGP incident occurred in **2008**, when a Pakistani ISP registered a new AS intending to block YouTube locally. However, due to a BGP misconfiguration, the route was advertised globally. As a result, many ASes saw this as the shortest path to YouTube, causing traffic from around the world to be routed through the Pakistani AS. This mistake made YouTube unreachable globally for several hours.

So the next time you stream a video, just imagine your data taking a complex, well-orchestrated trip across the globe guided by thousands of routers and networks all working together in perfect sync.
