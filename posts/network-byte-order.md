Let me explain.

Network byte order is the standard way of ordering bytes when sending data over the network.

**Big-endian:** Most Significant Byte (MSB) first, Least Significant Byte (LSB) last.  
Example: `0x12345678 → 12 34 56 78`

**Little-endian:** Least Significant Byte (LSB) first, Most Significant Byte (MSB) last.  
Example: `0x12345678 → 78 56 34 12`

If two machines have different endianness and we don’t standardize, the receiver will misinterpret the value.

Fields like port numbers, IP addresses, sequence numbers, etc., are multi-byte.  
If one host sends in little-endian and the other expects big-endian, the values will be wrong.

**Example: sending port `0x1F90` (8080)**

- Correct (big-endian): `1F 90` is 8080  
- Misinterpreted (little-endian): `90 1F` is 36895 (completely wrong port!)

**Where it’s not necessary**

Inside a single machine, byte order usually doesn’t matter because the CPU knows its own endianness.  

A single byte has only 8 bits, so there’s no “order” to worry about.
