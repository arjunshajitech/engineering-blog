# Start by Understanding the Problem

When a task is assigned or a plan is set, it’s easy to jump straight into coding without fully grasping the problem. This often leads to getting stuck halfway through.

Take the time to **think through possible solutions** and weigh the pros and cons of each.

By doing this, you’ll avoid the mistake of taking the easiest route. Once you have a clear plan, you can **refine your code** to make it work.

Make sure you **understand the problem completely** before writing a single line of code. This will help guide the flow of your solution.
